# Online course on topology in condensed matter

This is a open online course on topology in condensed matter.
Initially developed for the [edX platform](https://www.edx.org/course/topology-in-condensed-matter-tying-quantum-knots) in 2015, its development continues here.

After following this course you will:
- Discover how topological concepts manifest in condensed matter systems
- Get an overview of different research directions and important developments
- Learn to combine the relevant math with simulations and physical arguments to improve your understanding

Go right to the [introduction](w0_background/intro) for in-depth information about the course.

## Authors

The course was developed by

* Anton Akhmerov (TU Delft)
* Jay Sau (University of Maryland)
* Bernard van Heck (Leiden University)
* Sebastian Rubbert (TU Delft)
* Rafał Skolasiński (TU Delft)
* Bas Nijholt (TU Delft)
* Irfan Muhammad (TU Delft)
* Tómas Örn Rosdahl (TU Delft)

The introductory videos to each topic were contributed by multiple experts from the community.
